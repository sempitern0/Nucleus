Nucleus is a reusable **Godot 4.7 project template** for starting production games
with common infrastructure already separated into explicit ownership boundaries.
It is not an addon framework and it does not replace Godot's scene tree, physics,
rendering, animation, resources, multiplayer, navigation, or UI systems.

The intended relationship is:

```text
Godot native systems
        ↓
small Nucleus service/component contracts
        ↓
game-owned rules, content, art and product policy
```

## Current baseline

| Contract | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Template version | [`VERSION`](VERSION) |
| Reference engine | Godot `4.7.2-stable` |
| API stability | Pre-1.0; intentional public changes may still occur |
| Core validation | static audits + headless tests + smoke scenes |
| Export validation | Linux, Windows and Web smoke exports |
| License | [MIT](LICENSE) |

The template intentionally ships without a game main scene. The consuming project
owns its entry point and opts into only the systems it needs.

## Start in five minutes

1. Read [Installation](docs/guides/installation.md).
2. Open [Foundation Quickstart](docs/guides/foundation_quickstart.md).
3. Create your game's main scene under a game-owned directory.
4. Keep the six baseline Autoloads unless you intentionally redesign their contracts.
5. Run the validation sequence before substantial game-specific changes.

The complete documentation map is [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

## Core runtime

Nucleus keeps the global surface deliberately small:

```text
NucleusApp
NucleusSettings
NucleusInput
NucleusAudio
NucleusSave
NucleusSceneFlow
```

These services own cross-scene concerns only. Gameplay, UI composition, world
simulation and optional production tooling remain scene-owned by default.

| Need | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle, paths, logging, platform helpers | [Core runtime](docs/components/core_runtime.md) |
| Settings, input, rebinding, hot-swap | [Settings and input](docs/guides/settings_input_quickstart.md) |
| Audio, save, localization, scene flow | [Runtime services](docs/guides/runtime_services_quickstart.md) |
| Resource batches and loading UI | [Resource loading](docs/guides/resource_loading_quickstart.md) |
| UI, focus and accessibility | [UI and accessibility](docs/guides/ui_quickstart.md) |

## Gameplay composition

Nucleus favors small Nodes and Resources over inheritance-heavy base classes.
Typical gameplay is assembled from independent owners:

```text
Player
├── MotionInput
├── movement/camera components
├── ValuePool / attributes
├── DamageReceiver
├── GameplayAction set
├── StateMachine
└── interaction / targeting as needed
```

| Need | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Health/resources, damage, interaction, timing, state | [Gameplay foundation](docs/guides/gameplay_foundation_quickstart.md) |
| Actions, attributes, modifiers, status effects | [Actions / attributes / status](docs/guides/actions_attributes_status_quickstart.md) |
| Movement and camera | [Movement / camera](docs/components/gameplay_movement_camera.md) |
| Pooling, spawning and targeting | [Pooling / targeting](docs/guides/pooling_targeting_quickstart.md) |
| Camera feedback and game feel | [Camera / game feel](docs/guides/camera_game_feel_quickstart.md) |
| AnimationTree integration | [Animation integration](docs/guides/animation_integration_quickstart.md) |

## Accessibility and input comfort

The baseline includes controller hot-swap, source-aware prompts/glyphs, rebinding,
reduced motion, screen-flash intensity, UI-scale intent, high-contrast intent,
look sensitivity, separate gamepad movement/look deadzones, and a reusable
hold/toggle activation helper.

Nucleus stores neutral preferences and exposes adapters. The game remains the owner
of Theme, subtitle styling, contrast palette, action semantics and assist balance.

Start with:

- [Settings and Input Quickstart](docs/guides/settings_input_quickstart.md)
- [UI and Accessibility Quickstart](docs/guides/ui_quickstart.md)
- [Accessibility Preferences contract](docs/components/accessibility_preferences.md)

## Runtime efficiency

Nucleus includes opt-in tools for reducing frame spikes without introducing a
global optimization manager:

```text
performance sampling and regression reports
staggered low-frequency scheduling
activity gating
incremental pool prewarming
Utility AI staggering
render / physics audits
first-use PackedScene warmup
audio one-shot voice budgeting
UI refresh coalescing
incremental save capture
```

These tools do not automatically change renderer, physics, AI or content policy.
Measure a representative workload, apply one bounded intervention, then compare.

Start with:

- [Performance Quickstart](docs/guides/performance_quickstart.md)
- [Runtime Optimization Quickstart](docs/guides/runtime_optimization_quickstart.md)
- [Runtime Optimization tutorial](docs/guides/tutorials/runtime_optimization.md)

## Optional production modules

Optional modules are present in the template but are not promoted to baseline
Autoloads simply for convenience.

| Capability | Documentation |
| --- | --- |
| Performance diagnostics | [Performance](docs/guides/performance_quickstart.md) |
| Development command palette | [Development tools](docs/guides/development_tools_quickstart.md) |
| Networking bootstrap / LAN | [Networking](docs/guides/networking_quickstart.md) |
| Authoritative replication | [Online replication](docs/guides/online_replication_quickstart.md) |
| Inventory and equipment | [Inventory / equipment](docs/guides/inventory_equipment_quickstart.md) |
| Deterministic loot | [Loot](docs/guides/loot_quickstart.md) |
| Persistent world state | [Persistent world](docs/guides/persistent_world_quickstart.md) |
| Utility AI and navigation | [AI / navigation](docs/guides/ai_navigation_quickstart.md) |
| Platform/store boundary | [Platform services](docs/guides/platform_services_quickstart.md) |
| Signed DLC and data-only mods | [Content packs](docs/guides/content_packs_quickstart.md) |
| Touch/mobile integration | [Mobile](docs/guides/mobile_quickstart.md) |
| Procedural heightfield terrain | [Terrain](docs/guides/terrain_generation_quickstart.md) |

The terrain module owns reusable heightfield generation primitives and layouts.
Biome policy, island/world distribution for a specific game, objectives, content
placement, art direction and progression remain game-owned.

## Documentation model

Use the shortest layer that answers the question:

```text
README / docs index
    orientation
        ↓
*_quickstart.md
    ownership + minimum setup
        ↓
guides/tutorials/
    build one concrete integration
        ↓
components/ or modules/
    public contract, limits and extension rules
```

For game-shaped examples, use [Real-game patterns](docs/guides/real_game_patterns.md).

## Validation

Fast repository checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/ci/static_checks.py
python3 scripts/ci/documentation_audit.py
python3 scripts/ci/productization_audit.py
```

Authoritative Godot validation:

```bash
godot --headless --path . --import
godot --headless --path . res://tests/headless/test_runner.tscn
godot --headless --path . res://tests/smoke/smoke_main.tscn
```

Run the resource-loading smoke scene when `core/loading` changes. See
[Validation and CI](docs/guides/validation_ci_quickstart.md) for the complete gate.

## Compatibility and API policy

- [Godot compatibility](docs/policies/godot_compatibility.md)
- [API stability](docs/policies/api_stability.md)
- [Versioning](docs/policies/versioning.md)
- [Deprecation](docs/policies/deprecation.md)

Pin the Nucleus release, tag or source commit used by a consuming game. Vendoring
and selective upgrades are intentional.

## Contributing

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before modifying reusable contracts. The recurring
rules are: Godot-native first, explicit ownership, scene ownership by default,
composition over inheritance, no hidden dependencies between optional modules,
and executable evidence for reusable behavior.

## License

Nucleus is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE). A game built from the
template may use its own license while retaining the required notice for reused
Nucleus code.
