# Baseline Architecture

## Dependency direction

Nucleus follows this general direction:

```text
Godot native APIs
        ↑
Core infrastructure
        ↑
scene-owned Components
        ↑
game-specific composition
```

Optional modules sit beside the baseline and are adopted explicitly.

## Autoload policy

An Autoload is justified by genuine cross-scene lifetime, not convenience.

The default project currently loads:

```text
NucleusApp
NucleusSettings
NucleusInput
NucleusAudio
NucleusSave
NucleusSceneFlow
```

EventBus and NetworkHandler remain optional.

## Composition

Game-facing systems prefer small Nodes/Resources with explicit references,
signals, and source ownership.

Examples:

```text
ValuePool + DamageReceiver + Regenerator
StateMachine + AnimationTree binding
GameplayAction + requirements + costs + effects
Attribute + independent modifier sources
TargetingAgent + sensors + filters + scorers
Camera + independent feedback sources
```

This makes mechanics removable and prevents inheritance trees from encoding
every possible combination.

## Native Godot ownership

Nucleus adds reusable policy around native features rather than shadowing them:

```text
Input/InputMap
AudioServer/audio buses
TranslationServer
CharacterBody2D/3D
Area2D/3D
Camera2D/3D
AnimationTree
Tween
MultiplayerAPI
FileAccess/ConfigFile/resources
```

When Godot already has a good abstraction, use it.

## Communication

Prefer, in order:

1. direct call/reference when ownership is explicit;
2. local signal for observation;
3. source-owned registration for many producers;
4. optional EventBus only for genuine decoupling.

No Service Locator.

## Persistence

Runtime objects own behavior. Save/settings layers persist plain stable data.
Live Nodes, Callables, timers, and transient overlap/feedback state should not be
treated as durable data.

## Baseline completion

Iteration 17 completed the last planned large gameplay-composition layer.
Iteration 18 hardens trust, validation, documentation, and portability rather
than adding another major mechanic.
