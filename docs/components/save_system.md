# Save System Contract

## Ownership and entry points

`NucleusSave` is the application-wide Autoload for versioned save documents:
storage, codecs, validation, integrity, optional encryption, migration, backups
and slot operations. `NucleusSaveSession` is a scene-owned `Node` that gathers
game state through explicitly registered participants and restores it after load.
Neither service searches the SceneTree for gameplay state or defines game-specific
slot menus, progression, content or cloud-sync policy.

Use `NucleusSave.save_manual(slot_id, payload, metadata)` when a game already owns
a plain `Dictionary` payload. Use a `NucleusSaveSession` when the player, inventory,
world or other independent systems need capture/restore callbacks.

## Default directory and configuration

The effective root is `NucleusSave.profile.base_directory` **after** the
Autoload has entered the scene tree and initialized. Nucleus ships with
`core/save/defaults/default_save_profile.tres` assigned in `core/save/save.tscn`.
Its `base_directory` is empty, which resolves through
`NucleusSaveProfile.get_base_directory()` to:

~~~gdscript
OS.get_user_data_dir().path_join("saves")
~~~

`NucleusPaths.saves_directory()` is the corresponding helper. In the stock
project (named `Nucleus` in `project.godot`, without a custom user-data directory),
a typical Windows path is:

~~~text
%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\Nucleus\saves\
~~~

This is **user data**, not `res://saves` or a directory alongside the executable.
The physical directory depends on operating system, project name, Godot's
application user-directory settings and any explicitly configured save root.

Inspect the path at runtime, after initialization:

~~~gdscript
print(NucleusSave.profile.base_directory)
print(NucleusPaths.saves_directory())
~~~

The first line is authoritative if the save profile overrides the root; the
second shows the platform-specific *default*. To change the root, set
`base_directory` in the Save Profile resource to an absolute writable directory
before the service initializes. The service duplicates the Resource at startup,
validates it, creates the root and returns `ERR_UNCONFIGURED` for save operations
if initialization fails. Changing the project name or save root after release
changes where Nucleus looks; migrating existing user files is game policy.

## Slots and on-disk layout

Save IDs are normalized with `NucleusSavePaths.sanitize_slot_id()`: trimmed,
lowercased, spaces replaced with underscores, unsupported characters replaced
with underscores, leading/trailing underscores removed, and truncated to 64
characters. An empty normalized ID is invalid for write/delete operations.
Choose stable slot IDs once a game has shipped.

The default **binary, unencrypted** layout for `slot_1` is:

~~~text
<resolved-save-root>/
└── slot_1/
    ├── manual.nsav
    ├── manual.nsav.bak1
    ├── manual.nsav.bak2
    ├── quick.nsav
    ├── quick.nsav.bak1
    ├── quick.nsav.bak2
    └── autosaves/
        ├── auto_<unix_time_ms>.nsav
        └── auto_<unix_time_ms>.nsav
~~~

Files appear only after the relevant save operation; the tree is illustrative.
Manual and quick writes replace the corresponding format-specific main file,
with up to `backup_count` retained `.bakN` backups. Autosaves receive timestamped
names and are pruned to the requested `max_slots`; they do **not** use the
manual/quick backup rotation. Writes use a `.tmp` file and filesystem rename.
The repository can load a valid backup after a failed manual/quick primary load;
`NucleusSaveResult.recovered_from_backup` reports that recovery.

`NucleusSave.list_slots()` lists slot directories;
`NucleusSave.list_autosave_paths(slot_id)` lists autosaves newest by file
modification time; `NucleusSave.delete_slot(slot_id)` recursively removes a
slot and returns an `Error`. Deletion is not an undoable operation.

## Formats and save profile defaults

| Setting | Shipped default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `default_format` | `BINARY` | `.nsav`, type-preserving Godot Variant binary |
| Other codecs | `TEXT` / `JSON` | `.nsv` / `.json` |
| `backup_count` | `2` | Manual and quick saves |
| `max_file_size_mb` | `64` | Read-side file-size rejection |
| `encryption_mode` | `NONE` | Plain storage with SHA-256 corruption detection |
| `schema_version` | `1` | Application payload schema |
| `rewrite_migrated_saves` | `true` | Eligible migrated manual/quick documents |

Binary and Variant-text codecs preserve supported Godot Variant values; JSON
accepts only JSON-compatible values (for example strings, numbers, booleans,
arrays and string-keyed dictionaries). The JSON codec rejects unsupported
Variant types such as `Vector3` or `Color` rather than silently coercing them.

Payload and metadata dictionaries are validated before writing. Do not save live
Objects/Nodes, Callables, Signals, RIDs or non-string dictionary keys. Store
stable IDs and reconstruct runtime references on restore. Metadata is intended
for menu summaries, not authoritative gameplay state.

## Security and integrity

Every saved document has a SHA-256 checksum used to detect corruption.
**Checksum-only, unencrypted saves are not authenticated** and must not be
treated as tamper-proof or as a multiplayer authority boundary.

`NucleusSaveProfile.encryption_mode` also supports `PASSWORD` and `RAW_KEY`
(32-byte key), producing `.pwd` and `.key` suffixes respectively:

~~~text
manual.nsav.pwd
quick.nsv.key
auto_<unix_time_ms>.json.pwd
~~~

Provide credentials at runtime via `NucleusSave.configure_password(password)`
or `NucleusSave.configure_raw_key(key)` *before* reading or writing the encrypted
save. Passwords/keys are not stored in the Save Profile. Encrypted documents
also carry HMAC-SHA256 verification; mismatched credentials or integrity
failure make loading fail. Keep credentials recoverable through a game-owned
secure policy; losing them can make saves unreadable.

## Manual, quick, autosave and Continue

The global service exposes:

~~~gdscript
var saved: NucleusSaveResult = NucleusSave.save_manual(
    "slot_1",
    {"chapter": 2, "coins": 120},
    {"area": "Forest"},
)
if not saved.succeeded():
    push_error(error_string(saved.error))

var loaded: NucleusSaveResult = NucleusSave.load_latest("slot_1")
if loaded.succeeded():
    print(loaded.document.payload)
~~~

Other methods include `save_quick`, `save_autosave`, `load_manual`,
`load_quick` and `load_latest_autosave`. For participant-based scenes, use
`save_session.save_manual()`, `save_session.save_quick()`,
`save_session.autosave()` and `save_session.load_latest()`: successful loads
automatically route the payload to registered restore callbacks.

`load_latest()` tries the latest available candidate **per requested kind**,
selects the newest successfully decoded/verified document by microsecond update
timestamp, and uses the default kind order `AUTOSAVE → QUICKSAVE → MANUAL`
only to break identical timestamps. An explicit `PackedInt32Array` of kinds
limits eligible kinds and sets that tie order. Legacy whole-second timestamps
remain readable. A failed candidate can lose to a successful candidate from
another kind; this is **not** a scan of every older autosave. In particular,
`load_latest_autosave()` targets the newest autosave rather than automatically
trying the whole autosave history.

## Scene participants and autosave lifecycle

Register a stable ID, a capture Callable and an optional restore Callable:

~~~gdscript
save_session.register_participant(
    &"player",
    player.capture_state,
    player.restore_state,
)
~~~

`NucleusSaveSession` supports pending payload for late-registered restore
participants; register dependencies before their dependents if order matters.
`set_metadata_provider()` supplies display metadata separately.

Its default `NucleusAutosavePolicy` enables autosaving every 120 seconds, keeps
up to three autosaves per slot, enforces a five-second minimum between normal
successful autosaves, saves on application pause and quit, and does not
autosave on lost focus. `refresh_autosave_policy()` reapplies changed settings.
`autosave(force = true)` bypasses the minimum interval but still respects the
enabled flag; skipped saves return `ERR_BUSY` and emit `autosave_skipped`.

For many participants, `save_manual_incremental()`,
`save_quick_incremental()`, `autosave_incremental()` or
`capture_snapshot_incremental(participants_per_frame)` distribute participant
capture across frames **on the main thread**; they do not make disk writing
asynchronous. Pause/quit-triggered autosaves intentionally use the synchronous
path because another frame might never arrive.

## Schema migrations and observable failures

`NucleusSaveDocument` includes a container version, save kind, slot ID, game and
engine versions, schema version, created/updated timestamps, metadata, payload
and integrity data. `schema_version` describes the consuming game's payload
contract; registered `NucleusSaveMigration` resources form an ordered chain
when loading an older payload. Loading a newer schema, or lacking a required
migration step, fails explicitly.

A successful migration may rewrite a manual/quick save when
`rewrite_migrated_saves` is enabled; autosave migration does not rewrite the
original autosave. Test migrations on copies of real released saves.

All operations expose explicit `NucleusSaveResult.error` codes;
`succeeded()` means `error == OK`. Save/load results can also provide `path`,
`document`, `migrated` and `recovered_from_backup`. The global service emits
`save_completed` / `save_failed` and `load_completed` / `load_failed`;
the session emits `snapshot_saved` / `snapshot_loaded` and capture-progress
signals. Handle missing files, unconfigured credentials, validation errors,
corrupt data and absent migrations in the consuming game's UI.

## Boundaries and further reading

- `res://` stores authored game assets; writable player data belongs in user
  storage. Do not hardcode the Windows path for cross-platform games.
- Nucleus does not automatically implement cross-device sync, backup uploads,
  platform cloud-save quotas or conflict resolution. These are integration
  policies owned by the game/platform.
- Do not infer a successful *load* from a file's existence; use the explicit
  result and validated document.
