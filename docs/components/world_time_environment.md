# World Time and Environment Contract

Target engine: Godot 4.7.x.

## Scope

```text
components/world/time
components/world/environment
```

These components provide a scene-owned simulation clock, coarse day-period
classification, and optional native Godot daylight presentation.

They do not create a global world manager.

## Ownership

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
NucleusWorldClock
    simulation time only
        ↓
NucleusDayPeriodClassifier
    semantic dawn/day/dusk/night state

NucleusWorldClock
        ↓
NucleusDaylightDriver3D
        ↓
DirectionalLight3D / WorldEnvironment
```

The clock does not know that lights, skies, weather, NPCs, spawning, or saves
exist. Consumers observe or query it.

This separation is deliberate. A headless server can own the clock without any
rendering nodes, while a client can use the same time to drive presentation.

## NucleusWorldClock

`NucleusWorldClock` models a fixed 24-hour logical day:

```text
24 hours
1440 minutes
86400 game seconds
```

`day` is a zero-based logical day index, not a calendar date.

The clock stores:

```text
day
seconds_of_day
running
game_seconds_per_real_second
```

It exposes three advancement modes:

```text
IDLE
    advance from _process(delta)

PHYSICS
    advance from _physics_process(delta)

MANUAL
    never advances itself
```

`MANUAL` is the preferred mode when another authority owns simulation time, for
example a dedicated server tick, replay system, deterministic simulation, or
network snapshot.

### Time scale

`game_seconds_per_real_second` converts Godot delta into game time.

Examples:

```text
1.0     real time
60.0    one game minute per real second
3600.0  one game hour per real second
```

The automatic modes intentionally consume Godot's normal process/physics delta.
They therefore follow the SceneTree pause/process policy and engine time scale.
If a project needs a clock independent of those policies, use `MANUAL` and call
`advance_game_seconds()` from the owner of that simulation.

### Setting and querying time

Useful public methods:

```gdscript
clock.set_time_hms(3, 18, 30)
clock.advance_game_seconds(90.0)

var day := clock.get_day()
var hour := clock.get_hour()
var minute := clock.get_minute()
var normalized := clock.get_normalized_day_time()
```

`normalized` is in the range `0.0 .. 1.0` within the current day.

`set_total_game_seconds()` and `get_total_game_seconds()` are useful when a game
persists or replicates a single absolute simulation-time value.

Negative total time is clamped to zero. `set_time_hms()` rejects invalid day,
hour, minute, or second fields instead of silently wrapping malformed input.

### Signals and large jumps

The clock emits:

```text
time_changed
day_changed
hour_changed
minute_changed
running_changed
time_scale_changed
```

A large jump reports the previous and final values once. It does **not** emit one
signal for every skipped minute/hour/day.

This is important for loading saves, sleeping until morning, fast travel, or
server correction. Systems that must process every elapsed interval should own
that simulation explicitly rather than infer work from UI-oriented clock
signals.

## Persistence

`capture_state()` returns stable plain data and `restore_state()` validates it.
The captured schema contains:

```text
schema_version
day
seconds_of_day
running
game_seconds_per_real_second
```

The clock does not write files and does not register itself with `NucleusSave`.
The consuming game's save document decides whether world time is durable.

Example shape:

```gdscript
save_document["world_clock"] = clock.capture_state()

# after loading
clock.restore_state(save_document.get("world_clock", {}))
```

Calendars, named weekdays, seasons, moon phases, holidays, and game-specific
schedule data remain game-owned.

## NucleusDayPeriodClassifier

`NucleusDayPeriodClassifier` maps the clock to four coarse semantic periods:

```text
DAWN
DAY
DUSK
NIGHT
```

Default boundaries are:

```text
dawn  05:00
day   07:00
dusk  18:00
night 21:00
```

They are configurable in decimal hours and must satisfy:

```text
dawn < day < dusk < night
```

Night wraps across midnight automatically.

The classifier is intentionally small. It is useful for rules such as:

```text
activate street lamps at night
change ambient audio at dusk
open a shop during the day
select spawn tables by period
```

It does not drive rendering and it does not own arbitrary schedules.

A classifier can be a child of its clock and auto-resolve that parent, or it can
receive an explicit `clock` reference.

## NucleusDaylightProfile

`NucleusDaylightProfile` is reusable presentation data for a 3D daylight driver.
It defines:

```text
sun energy/color/orbit offsets
moon energy/color/orbit offsets
optional shadow gating
background energy
ambient energy
```

Optional `Curve` resources are sampled over normalized day time. Curve output is
interpreted as a normalized `0..1` response and clamped before application.

When no curves are assigned, the profile uses a cheap analytical fallback:

```text
sun peaks at noon
moon peaks at midnight
background/ambient interpolate between night and day values
```

Color gradients are optional. Missing gradients preserve neutral white light.
This avoids embedding an art direction in Nucleus.

## NucleusDaylightDriver3D

`NucleusDaylightDriver3D` is a scene-owned adapter between `NucleusWorldClock`
and native Godot rendering nodes.

It can target any combination of:

```text
DirectionalLight3D sun
DirectionalLight3D moon
WorldEnvironment
```

Every clock change calls `apply_now()` and updates only assigned targets.

The driver writes:

```text
DirectionalLight3D.rotation_degrees
DirectionalLight3D.light_energy
DirectionalLight3D.light_color
DirectionalLight3D.shadow_enabled (optional)
Environment.background_energy_multiplier
Environment.ambient_light_energy
```

It does **not** modify:

```text
sky shader parameters
fog
clouds
weather
post-processing
exposure policy
art-specific celestial meshes
```

Those remain native/project-specific adapters around the clock.

### Typical scene

```text
World
├── WorldClock (NucleusWorldClock)
│   └── Periods (NucleusDayPeriodClassifier)
├── Sun (DirectionalLight3D)
├── Moon (DirectionalLight3D)
├── WorldEnvironment
└── Daylight (NucleusDaylightDriver3D)
```

Assign the same clock to `Daylight.clock`, create a
`NucleusDaylightProfile`, and assign whichever native targets the scene owns.

The driver has editor configuration warnings for missing required references and
for a `WorldEnvironment` without an `Environment` resource.

Disabling the driver stops future writes. It intentionally does not restore an
older light/environment state because ownership of that previous presentation is
not knowable generically.

## Multiplayer and authority

Nucleus does not replicate the clock automatically.

Recommended authoritative shape:

```text
server
    owns total game seconds + rate
        ↓
client receives epoch/snapshot
        ↓
client corrects local NucleusWorldClock
        ↓
local presentation observes clock
```

Do not synchronize sun transforms as the source of truth when all clients can
derive them from one authoritative time value and the same presentation profile.

For competitive or simulation-sensitive rules, the authoritative gameplay owner
must query authoritative time. Client daylight is presentation, not authority.

## Performance

`NucleusWorldClock` is constant-time and allocates no per-frame collections.

`NucleusDayPeriodClassifier` only recomputes when clock time changes.

`NucleusDaylightDriver3D` performs direct property writes when time changes. It
does not create viewports, render textures, shaders, or scene-global managers.

If a project advances its clock every frame, daylight also updates every frame.
For extremely slow clocks where that is unnecessary, advance the clock at a
lower explicit cadence in `MANUAL` mode.

## What stays game-owned

Nucleus intentionally does not decide:

```text
calendar/date system
seasons and astronomy
weather transitions
NPC schedules
plant/crop growth
shops opening/closing
sleep mechanics
sunrise/sunset latitude simulation
cloud/sky shader implementation
which systems persist across a new game
network correction/interpolation policy
```

Those systems consume world time; they do not belong inside the clock.
