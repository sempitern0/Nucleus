# Composition recipes: from a game idea to working Nucleus owners

This companion to the [use-case catalog](use_case_catalog.md) gives **mechanic-
shaped starting points**. Recipes are intentionally small. They tell a human or
AI where to begin, not which art, combat or progression decisions to hard-code.
The linked contracts contain the real class signatures and Inspector setup.

## Casos de uso / Use cases

### 1. A door that opens and remains open after reload

**Components:** native `Area3D` or ray interaction, Nucleus interaction,
`NucleusSave`/World State. **Game owns:** door eligibility, animation, sound,
unique persistent ID and closed/open rules.

1. Define a stable door ID and a versioned `{open: bool}` document.
2. Observe interaction in the native scene. Reject out-of-range/locked requests.
3. Change the door state in the game owner, then play AnimationTree/AnimationPlayer.
4. Capture and restore through the documented save/world-state boundary.
5. Test new game, save, reload, duplicate IDs and a rejected locked-door action.

Read [interaction](../components/gameplay_foundation.md),
[world state](../modules/persistent_world_state.md), and
[save](../components/save_system.md).

### 2. A stamina-limited dodge or sprint

**Components:** semantic input, value pool, gameplay action/timing, native
CharacterBody motor and AnimationTree. **Game owns:** stamina cost, speed,
invulnerability and cooldown.

1. Keep one motor authority each physics tick.
2. Feed an action request from semantic input, checking resource/cooldown first.
3. Subtract stamina only after action admission; drive the motor and feedback.
4. Restore stamina through the neutral regeneration component if needed.
5. Test zero stamina, input remapping, pause, interrupted dodge and save scope.

Read [movement](../components/gameplay_movement_camera.md),
[actions](../components/gameplay_actions_attributes_status.md) and
[gameplay foundations](../components/gameplay_foundation.md).

### 3. Enemies that patrol, detect, pursue and disengage

**Components:** native NavigationAgent, AI utilities, target sensing and FSM.
**Game owns:** patrol graph, perception rules, relationships, tactics, attacks.

1. Start with deterministic decision fixtures before adding animations.
2. Use existing target filters/scorers and guard against vanished targets.
3. Stagger low-priority decision updates; keep navigation movement frame-correct.
4. Drive animation from accepted state, not from competing position writers.
5. Test target loss, unreachable path, occlusion, authority and large NPC count.

Read [AI](../modules/ai_navigation.md),
[targeting](../components/gameplay_pooling_targeting.md) and

3. Feed materialized terrain to visual/collision owners and real surface queries.
4. Consult the world mask for game-owned scatter density rules.
5. Stream only the needed visual/physical regions; keep persistent descriptors.
6. Test reproducible seeds, teleport across cells, collision readiness and budgets.

### 6. A boat floating on animated water

**Components:** analytical SurfaceSampler3D, Buoyancy3D, native rigid body.
**Game owns:** wave simulation, steering, boarding, wake appearance and sounds.

1. Expose the water's physical height/normal/velocity through a sampler adapter.
2. Give hull buoyancy one authoritative physics owner.
3. Sample at the simulation time, not arbitrary shader visual displacement.
4. Emit optional presentation stamps only for real motion and meaningful contacts.
5. Test water-shore-water transitions, stable idle hull and physics under waves.

Read [surface sampling](../components/world_surfaces.md),
[buoyancy](../components/world_buoyancy.md) and
[transient marks](../components/world_feedback.md).

### 7. Floating NPC nameplates in a crowded world

**Components:** Nucleus world-space anchors and label layout. **Game owns:**
label visibility permissions, name/team style, health source and occlusion policy.

1. Bind each label to one valid Node3D and a `Control` scene.
2. Supply the active camera; avoid updating all distant labels every frame.
3. Use layout overlap constraints and explicitly hide unplaceable labels.
4. Test behind-camera, offscreen, deep distance, camera changes, crowded actors.

Read [world anchors](../components/ui_world_anchors.md) and
[UI accessibility](../components/ui_and_accessibility.md).

### 8. Multiplayer players that do not replicate the whole map

**Components:** networking bootstrap, server-owned intent validation, native
Spawner/Synchronizer, transform snapshots, spatial interest management, recovery.
**Game owns:** authentication, ownership, authorized visibility and game state.

1. Establish a transport and authenticate the session; never trust client positions.
2. Spawn network actors via native Godot APIs on the authoritative peer.
3. Validate gameplay intents separately from transport-level shape/rate checks.
4. Select candidate interest on the server and authorize every visibility change.
5. Restore identity and relevant state after reconnect; handle stale messages.
6. Test two clients and a server, packet loss, teleport, reconnect and despawn.

3. Update/remap the index when objects move, resize or are removed.
4. Test negative coordinates, boundaries, extreme zoom and draw order.

Read [2D index](../components/spatial_rect_index_2d.md).

### 12. A game that stutters when lots of content appears

**Components:** NucleusPerformanceSampler, optional section profiling,
materialization queues, warmup and scheduling. **Game owns:** frame-time budget
and acceptable latency for low-priority jobs.

1. Capture the same workload before changing quality or scheduling.
2. Identify CPU, GPU, resource loading or physics evidence using native tools.
3. Use exactly one bounded intervention, retaining correctness and ownership.
4. Compare captures under matching target renderer/hardware.
5. Report frame-time p95/p99 if measured, and any behavior regressions.

[sections](../modules/performance_sections.md) and
[runtime optimization](../components/runtime_optimization.md).

## What to do when no recipe matches

Write the game-owned behavior, then search native Godot and the
[capability catalog](use_case_catalog.md). Ask whether the difference is a
reusable **mechanism** or product-specific **policy**. Build it locally first;
add a new Nucleus contract only when the maintenance and reuse case is clear.
