# Tutorial: ship English and Spanish with a persistent language selector

This tutorial builds a tiny localized menu using Godot translation resources and
the Nucleus locale setting/binding.

At the end:

- English and Spanish are loaded by Godot;
- visible menu text changes at runtime;
- an `OptionButton` is populated automatically;
- the player's explicit language choice persists;
- `Automatic` follows Nucleus locale resolution/fallback rules.

## 1. Create translation files

Create a game-owned directory:

```text
res://assets/localization/
```

Create `en.po`:

```po
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Language: en\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

msgid "MAIN_MENU_TITLE"
msgstr "Main Menu"

msgid "NEW_GAME"
msgstr "New Game"

msgid "OPTIONS"
msgstr "Options"

msgid "LANGUAGE"
msgstr "Language"

msgid "Automatic"
msgstr "Automatic"
```

Create `es.po`:

```po
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Language: es\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

msgid "MAIN_MENU_TITLE"
msgstr "Menú principal"

msgid "NEW_GAME"
msgstr "Nueva partida"

msgid "OPTIONS"
msgstr "Opciones"

msgid "LANGUAGE"
msgstr "Idioma"

msgid "Automatic"
msgstr "Automático"
```

## 2. Register them with Godot

In Project Settings, add both imported translation resources to Godot's
localization translations list.

This step matters because Nucleus discovers available languages through
`TranslationServer.get_loaded_locales()`.

Do not maintain a second "enabled language list" in game code unless the game has
an intentional product restriction.

## 3. Build a small scene

```text
LocalizationDemo : Control
└── VBoxContainer
    ├── Title : Label
    ├── NewGame : Button
    ├── Options : Button
    └── LanguageRow : HBoxContainer
        ├── LanguageLabel : Label
        └── Language : OptionButton
            └── LocaleBinding : NucleusLocaleOptionBinding
```

Leave the binding's default setting/catalog in place.

Useful starting values:

```text
include_automatic = true
loaded_locales_only = true
use_native_names = true
show_locale_code = true   # useful while validating
```

## 4. Refresh manually assigned strings

Attach this script to `LocalizationDemo`:

```gdscript
extends Control


func _ready() -> void:
    _refresh_text()


func _notification(what: int) -> void:
    if what == NOTIFICATION_TRANSLATION_CHANGED and is_node_ready():
        _refresh_text()


func _refresh_text() -> void:
    %Title.text = tr("MAIN_MENU_TITLE")
    %NewGame.text = tr("NEW_GAME")
    %Options.text = tr("OPTIONS")
    %LanguageLabel.text = tr("LANGUAGE")
```

This is normal Godot behavior: values you assign manually with `tr()` need to be
assigned again when the active translation changes.

The locale selector itself listens for translation changes and repopulates its
presentation automatically.

## 5. Run and change language

When you select Spanish, this path occurs:

```text
OptionButton
→ NucleusLocaleOptionBinding
→ NucleusSettings.set_value("localization/locale", "es")
→ NucleusLocalizationSettingsApplier
→ NucleusLocalization.apply_locale("es")
→ TranslationServer.set_locale(...)
→ NOTIFICATION_TRANSLATION_CHANGED
→ visible UI refresh
```

You should not need a custom language-manager singleton.

## 6. Restart and verify persistence

Select Spanish, close the game and launch again.

The stored settings value should be applied on startup and the menu should render
using Spanish.

Select `Automatic` and restart again. The setting now stores:

```text
automatic
```

while `NucleusLocalization` resolves the actual runtime locale.

## 7. Inspect the resolved locale

For diagnostics:

```gdscript
print("Setting: ", NucleusSettings.get_value(&"localization/locale"))
print("Applied: ", TranslationServer.get_locale())
print("Loaded: ", NucleusLocalization.get_loaded_locales())
```

The setting and the applied locale are intentionally not always identical:
`automatic` is a policy request, while `TranslationServer.get_locale()` is the
resolved runtime locale.

## 8. Curate language names only when necessary

The default `NucleusLocaleCatalog` supplies presentation metadata for common
locales.

You can provide your own catalog to the binding when a product needs curated
names or a restricted list.

Remember:

```text
translation loaded by Godot
    = actual language availability

locale catalog
    = optional presentation metadata
```

## 9. Region fallback exercise

If you later ship `es_ES` but the OS reports another Spanish variant, inspect:

```gdscript
NucleusLocalization.resolve_locale("es_MX")
```

Nucleus asks Godot's locale comparison to find the best loaded match before
falling back.

This is preferable to hand-written `if locale.begins_with("es")` logic scattered
through the game.

## 10. RTL exercise

Print:

```gdscript
print(NucleusLocalization.is_right_to_left())
```

When adding Arabic/Hebrew later, use this as one input to game-owned UI layout
policy. It does not automatically solve fonts, icon direction, or layout
mirroring.

## Common mistakes

- changing `TranslationServer` directly from the `OptionButton`;
- putting language names in a second hard-coded array;
- storing "Nueva partida" in a save instead of a stable ID/key;
- assuming setting `automatic` is itself a real locale code;
- forgetting manual text refresh on locale change.
