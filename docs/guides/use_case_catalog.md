# Game development use cases / Casos de uso

This is the **problem-first navigation layer** for humans and coding agents. Start with
a behavior you want to build, follow the linked contract, and keep the final
gameplay/content/art policy in the consuming game. This catalog is also stored
in machine-readable form in [`../use_case_registry.json`](../use_case_registry.json).

## Choose a route

1. Find the closest player/developer problem below.
2. Open the linked canonical document and inspect the actual source owner.
3. Read the relevant quickstart or tutorial for a minimum working scene.
4. Author game-specific behavior next to its owning scene, not as a Nucleus Autoload.
5. Validate headless + a real gameplay/editor scene where the change is observable.

If none fits, prefer native Godot APIs and a game-local implementation. Extract
a Nucleus feature only after independent reuse is demonstrated. See
[`ai_composition_workflow.md`](ai_composition_workflow.md) for the coding workflow.

## What the catalog does not promise

- A component is not a finished RPG/MMO/survival/puzzle mechanic; the game wires inputs, state and feedback.
- A valid API call is not a trust decision; authoritative worlds validate requests and visibility.
- A smoke/headless test is not proof of feel, visuals, latency or frame budget on real hardware.
- Generic tools should not replace Godot physics, animation, navigation or UndoRedo.
- Do not add a global manager merely to make a generated mechanic easier to access.
