# Validation and CI Quickstart

Nucleus has one authoritative automated path: load the real Godot project so the
normal Autoload contract exists, then run the registered headless suites and smoke
scenes.

## 1. Repository checks

```bash
python3 scripts/ci/static_checks.py
python3 scripts/ci/documentation_audit.py
python3 scripts/ci/productization_audit.py
```

These catch source conventions, test-manifest mistakes, documentation coverage
and productization contract errors without pretending to be runtime validation.

## 2. Import with the CI engine

```bash
godot --headless --path . --import
```

The release-gated reference is currently Godot `4.7.2-stable`.

## 3. Run the native test scene

```bash
godot --headless --path . res://tests/headless/test_runner.tscn
```

Every dependency-free regression suite lives under `tests/headless/*_test.gd`,
extends `tests/headless/test_case.gd`, returns `finish()`, and is registered in
`tests/headless/test_manifest.gd`.

The runner is a normal project scene on purpose. Do not replace this with
`godot --script tests/headless/test_runner.gd`: transitive Nucleus source expects
the project's Autoloads to exist during compilation and execution.

### Editor workflow

For fast local iteration, open:

```text
tests/headless/test_runner.tscn
```

and press **F6 — Run Current Scene**. The same suite graph is used in editor and headless validation; there is no
second editor-only test contract.

## 4. Smoke scenes

Baseline Core/Autoload smoke:

```bash
godot --headless --path . res://tests/smoke/smoke_main.tscn
```

Threaded resource-loading smoke:

```bash
godot --headless --path . res://tests/smoke/resource_loading_smoke.tscn
```

Run the loading smoke whenever `core/loading`, warmup/loading integration or its
public presentation bindings change.

## 5. Manual validation scenes

Use representative scenes under `examples/` for visual or interaction behavior
that cannot be proven headlessly. Examples include gameplay, UI polish, terrain,
decals and other scene-owned integrations.

A manual scene is evidence for its visual/interaction contract; it is not a
replacement for the automated suite.

## 6. Smoke exports

With official export templates installed:

```bash
GODOT_BIN=/path/to/godot bash scripts/ci/smoke_exports.sh "$PWD"
```

The CI workflow validates Linux, Windows and Web packaging for the reusable
baseline. That proves exportability of Nucleus itself, not every game-specific
renderer/plugin/platform SDK.

## Recommended order

```text
1. static/documentation/productization audits
2. headless import
3. native test scene
4. affected smoke scene(s)
5. affected manual validation scene(s)
6. smoke exports for release-facing work
```

Call a change runtime-green only after the relevant Godot steps have actually
executed successfully.
