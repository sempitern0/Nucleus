# Optional AI / Navigation Module

`modules/ai` is optional and scene-owned. It separates **decision**, **behavior**,
**navigation intent**, **physical locomotion**, and **presentation**.

## Ownership

```text
TargetingAgent
    perception / selected target
        ↓
UtilityBrain
    choose intention
        ↓
AIStateMachineBridge
        ↓
StateMachine / game behavior
        ↓
NavigationFollower
    path / avoidance velocity
        ↓
NavigationMotionSource3D
        ↓
CharacterMotor3D
    acceleration / gravity / collision
        ↓
CharacterBody3D.velocity
        ↓
animation / facing presentation
```

The module does not provide an Enemy base class, global AI manager, duplicate
physics motor, Behavior Tree/GOAP framework, or replacement NavigationServer.

## Shared locomotion

`NucleusNavigationMotionSource3D` is the standard adapter for ground AI using
`NucleusCharacterMotor3D`.

It consumes the follower's resolved `output_velocity`, including native
avoidance output when avoidance is enabled.

`CharacterMotor3D` stays responsible for:

```text
acceleration / deceleration
speed multipliers
gravity
jump
move_and_slide()
ground transitions
```

This means player and AI actors can share identical locomotion tuning.

By default the navigation source synchronizes:

```text
NavigationFollower3D.movement_speed
NavigationAgent3D.max_speed
```

The setup assistant also places `NavigationFollower3D` one physics priority
before `CharacterMotor3D` by default, preventing a tree-order-dependent frame of
intent latency. Disable that policy only when the project owns process order
explicitly.

to `CharacterMotor3D.get_max_planar_speed()`.

Disable that synchronization only when the project intentionally needs navigation
intent capped differently from physical locomotion.

## Utility AI

`NucleusAIUtilityBrain` evaluates `NucleusAIUtilityOption` resources. Scores are
base score multiplied by normalized considerations. Explicit priority breaks
equal scores, then authored array order is deterministic.

`current_option_bonus` provides small hysteresis around close decisions.

Context providers contribute side-effect-free ephemeral values and may notify the
brain when an event warrants reevaluation.

The brain chooses intent. It does not move, attack, animate, or transition states
directly.

## Utility → gameplay state

Existing:

```text
NucleusAIStateBinding
NucleusAIStateMachineBridge
```

map a winning utility option to an existing `NucleusStateMachine` state.

Do not duplicate this with an AI-specific animation controller.

A state such as Chase normally owns only goal policy:

```text
enter
    follower.follow_node(target)

exit
    follower.clear_target()
```

The shared locomotion chain moves the actor continuously.

## Actions

AI and players should reuse the same `NucleusGameplayAction` where their gameplay
rules are the same.

For example:

```text
player input ───────┐
                    ├→ Attack GameplayAction
AI Attack state ────┘
```

The action can own requirements, costs, cooldown and effects. Animation remains a
presentation effect/OneShot rather than the authority deciding whether the
attack is valid.

## Navigation followers

`NucleusNavigationFollower2D/3D` own target/repath throttling,
`get_next_path_position()`, desired velocity and optional native RVO velocity
handoff.

They do not call `move_and_slide()`.

Moving targets require both displacement and minimum-time thresholds before a new
path target is requested.

Avoidance is opt-in because it has meaningful runtime cost with many agents.

## Facing and strafing

Use the shared `NucleusMovementFacing3D`:

```text
MOVEMENT
    patrol / normal chase

TARGET
    combat strafe while keeping attention on target

DIRECTION
    scripted or tactical facing
```

Directional `AnimationTree` locomotion then reads actual local body velocity, so
left/right/backward strafe clips work without the AI selecting clips.

## Animation

AI does not need a separate animation controller.

```text
Navigation
→ shared CharacterMotor3D
→ CharacterBody3D.velocity
→ NucleusAnimationVelocityBinding3D
→ same AnimationTree used by a player
```

High-level gameplay state may still feed `NucleusAnimationTreeStateBinding`, and
GameplayActions may trigger OneShots.

## AI character setup assistant

`NucleusAICharacterSetup3D` is an editor-oriented wiring/diagnostic helper.

It can resolve and wire:

```text
CharacterBody3D
CharacterMotor3D
NavigationAgent3D
NavigationFollower3D
NavigationMotionSource3D
UtilityBrain
StateMachine
AIStateMachineBridge
TargetingAgent
MovementFacing3D
AnimationVelocityBinding3D
```

It may create plumbing components such as motor/follower/motion source/bridge
when explicitly requested.

It does **not** invent:

```text
utility options
state semantics
attack behavior
targeting rules
navigation mesh
state bindings
animation clips
```

Those remain game-owned.

## Scheduled evaluation

Automatic Utility AI may bind to `NucleusUpdateScheduler`.

A useful large-crowd cadence is conceptually:

```text
utility decisions       low frequency / staggered
target/perception       project-dependent cadence
path repath              displacement + interval throttled
navigation steering      physics
CharacterMotor3D         physics
animation pose           quality-dependent presentation cadence
```

Do not reduce the physical motor to a low-frequency AI tick.

## Persistence / networking

Persist durable actor state and reconstruct native path internals after load.

For authoritative multiplayer, run decision/navigation/gameplay movement on the
authority and replicate resolved gameplay state. This module defines no RPC
protocol.
